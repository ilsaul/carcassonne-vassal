<p><b><u>The Table</u></b><br>
This is the area in which tiles are placed into play.  There is a visible grid on the table which shows you where tiles will be placed.  A square is shown in the center of the table (to indicate where to place your first tile).  The "zoom" of the table can be modified by clicking on the zoom buttons.  In addition the "Overview" button will toggle the display of the table overview (which can be helpful during large games).
You can not hide the table.
<h2>Setup</h2>
To set up a new game, choose the "New Game" item from the "File" menu.  To draw Scout tiles, click on the Scout
<h2>Game Play</h2>
Once a game has been created and players have connected <i>(see the vassal help for how to play online)</i> the game can begin.<p>
A player generally begins their move by dragging a tile from "Draw" stack to the "Stage" stack.  <i>(At the beginning of a game the start tile already exist in the "Stage" stack)</i>  Placing the tile in the "Stage" stack allows opponents to view the tile as the player contemplates how they will place the tile.  After contemplation, the player drags the tile from the "Stage" stack to the Table.  On the table, tiles will automatically snap to the visible grid.  Once on the table, tiles can be rotated via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-[</b> and <b>CTRL-]</b>.  Once a player is satisfied with the position and orientation of their tile, they "place" the tile via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-P</b>.  Once placed, the tile will have a thick red outline.  This outline always surrounds the most recently "placed" tile.  Once a tile is "placed" it can not be moved or rotated.  If a tile is "placed" in error, click on "Undo" twice, reposition it, and then "place" it again.<p>
Often after placing a tile, a player is allowed to place a piece onto that tile.  To do so, drag the piece from the game window to the table.  Player's meeples (followers) have two positions; standing <img src="images/meeple-red.png" border="0"> and lying down <img src="images/meeple-red-2.png" border="0">.  Generally, players indicate a meeple is used as a hunter by changing the position of the meeple to it is clear the meeple is in the field, and not on some other feature.  Change a meeples position via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-L</b>.<p>
When features are scored, pieces can be returned to their owner's supplies via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-A</b>.<p>
When a player has finished their move, the easiest way to signal that is pressing the "Done" button or by pressing <b>CTRL-D</b>.<p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
Whenever scoring meeples share the same spot on the scoring track, they "stack together".  To select individual scoring meeples when stacked, first double-click on the stack of scoring meeples, then select your meeple to move it.  As you move your scoring meeples on the score track, the game will report scoring changes in the message window.  If you complete one trip around the score track you can increase your score by 50 points via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-]</b>.
<h2>Shifting the Table</h2>
In general, if you start in the center of the table there will be plenty of room to play the game.  However, if you run out of room, you can shift the entire table in any direction.  (This is optional, and some players like to play bound by the table size.  Players should agree prior to the game if they will allow the table to be shifted.)  Be sure to use the "Overview" feature while you shift the table so you don't shift some pieces off the table!<p>
Shift the table by using the arrow buttons
