Both "anytile" & "placedtile" gets highlight prototype  (highlight proto must be below the player restriction in "placedtile"

"anytile" gets a trigger for CTRL-P
  If playerSide = LANG_Red && CurrentMap = Main Map
    C-A-S_P (triggers C-A-S_P for all "placedtiles" that match [isplaced = 1 and whoplaced = Side]
    C-A-S_Q (highlight)
    C-A-S_A (swap with "placedtile") (preserve state) (fire-after-swap: C-A-S_A) 
      now as "placedtile"
        Inherrits Rotation, and Highlight states from "anytile"
        C-A-S_A (sets whoplaced to "LANG_Red")

"placedtile" gets a trigger for C-A-S_P
  C-A-S_U (clears highlight)
  C-A-S_PERIOD (makes this "already placed")


Process of tiles getting placed
  START with "anytile"
  Put "anytile" onto the table
  Trigger a CTRL-P on "anytile" (might be from selected, might be from "Finish move")
    globally clears any highlights from tiles that match [isplaced = 1 and whoplaced = Side] (previously placed tiles)
    "anytile" gets highlighted (the proper color)
    "anytile" gets swapped with "placedtile" and triggers the whoplaced property

  Now we have a highlighted "placedtile" with [isplaced = 1] and [whoplaced = Side]
    this tile gets cleared the next time that Side places a tile

Finish Move (is triggered globaly by CTRL-F)
 - Causes any tiles (on the table) that have not been placed (isplaced = 0) to be "placed" (CTRL-P)
 - Announces the move is finished (chatter message)
