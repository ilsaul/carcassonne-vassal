</div>
</div>
<div class="guide_subsection">
<div class="guide_subheader">
The Table
</div>
<div class="guide_subdata">
This is the area in which tiles are placed into play.  There is a visible grid on the table which shows you where tiles will be placed.
A square is shown in the center of the table (to indicate where to place your first tile).  The "zoom" of the table can be modified by clicking on the zoom buttons (magnifying glass).
In addition, you can view the entire table with the table overview (which can be helpful during large games).
You can toggle the table overview display by clicking on the "Overview" button or by pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL-SHIFT-O</span>.
You can not hide the table.
The standard start tile is automatically placed in the center of the table. <i>NOTE: Some expansions cause the standard start tile to be removed.</i>
</div>
</div>
<div class="guide_section_header">Game Setup</div>
<div class="guide_section_data">
<p>
To set up a new game, choose the "New Game" item from the "File" menu.
After a game has been created, expansions can be added.  Click on the expansion you wish to add.  The needed tiles and tokens will be added to the game.
If desired, tokens for colors not used can be removed.  Click on the meeple of the color you wish to remove.
</p>
</div>
<div class="guide_section_header">Game Play</div>
<div class="guide_section_data">
<p>
Once a game has been created and players have connected <i>(see the vassal help for how to play online)</i> the game can begin.
</p>
<p>
A player generally begins their move by dragging a tile from "Draw" stack to the "Stage" stack on the "Tiles" window.
<i>(At the beginning of a game tiles might be drawn instead from the "River Tiles" window")</i>
</p>
<p>
Placing the tile in the "Stage" stack allows opponents to view the tile as the player contemplates how they will place the tile.  After contemplation, the player drags the tile from the "Stage" stack to the Table.  On the table, tiles will automatically snap to the visible grid.  In the "stage" stack or the table, tiles can be rotated via the right-click menu or by pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL-[</span> and <span class="controlkey">CTRL-]</span>.</p>
<p>
Once a player is satisfied with the position and orientation of their tile, they often are allowed to place a token onto that tile.  To do so, drag the token from the game window to the table.  Player's meeples (followers) have two positions; standing and lying down.  Generally, players indicate a meeple is used as a farmer by changing the position of the meeple.  The position of meeples can be changed via the right-click menu or by pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL-L</span>.
</p>

<p>
When a player's turn is complete, finish the move by pressning the "Finished" button or by pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL-F</span>.  Finishing in this way will "place" the tiles, and mark the last moved tile with your color.  This prevents the tiles from being moved with in the future.  If you "placed" a tile or "finished" by mistake, click the Undo button.
</p>
</div>
<div class="guide_section_header">Scoring</div>
<div class="guide_section_data">
<p>Scoring is done on the Game Window.  Pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL-=</span> will print the current scores in the message window.  There are two options for moving your score meeple around the scoring track.</p>
<div class="guide_subheader">
Hot Key Scoring
</div>
<div class="guide_subdata">
Pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL</span> and any number will advance YOUR score meeple that many spaces (0 will advance your meeple 10 spaces).  If you need to score yourself 8 points, press <span class="controlkey">CTRL-8</span>.  10 points, press <span class="controlkey">CTRL-0</span>.  14 points, press <span class="controlkey">CTRL-7</span> twice.  You do not need to have the game window open to score this way, and the scores will be reported in the message window.  You can only control your OWN score meeple in this way.
</div>
<div class="guide_subheader">
Manual Scoring
</div>
<div class="guide_subdata">
Just drag the scoring meeple to another spot on the score track.  Whenever scoring meeples share the same spot on the scoring track, they "stack together".  To select individual scoring meeples when stacked, first double-click on the stack of scoring meeples, then select your meeple to move it.  As you move your scoring meeples on the score track, the game will report scoring changes in the message window.  If you complete one trip around the score track you can increase your score by 50 points via the right-click menu or by pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL-]</span>.
</div>
</div>
<div class="guide_section_header">Shifting the Table</div>
<div class="guide_section_data">
<p>
In general, if you start in the center of the table there will be plenty of room to play the game.  However, if you run out of room, you can shift the entire table in any direction.  (This is optional, and some players like to play bound by the table size.  Players should agree prior to the game if they will allow the table to be shifted.)  Be sure to use the "Overview" feature while you shift the table so you don't shift some pieces off the table!  If you do, you can use Undo to fix that.  Shift the table by pressing the buttons with the thick black arrows or by pressing <span class="controlkey">CTRL</span> plus any of the arrow keyboard keys.
