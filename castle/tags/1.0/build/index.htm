<h2>The Module</h2>
This module was created by Tim Byrne with the scanning help of Brian Mola.<p>

<h2>Interface</h2>
You will find the following screens within the module:
<p><b><u>The Message Window</u></b><br>
<table border="0"><tr valign="top"><td>
<img src="images/help_msg.png" border="1">
</td><td>
The message window is where all messages concerning the game are printed, and allows you to chat with your opponents.
You can not hide the message window.
</td></tr></table>
<p><b><u>The Game Window</u></b><br>
<table border="0"><tr valign="top"><td>
<img src="images/help_gamewindow.png" border="1">
</td><td>
The game window contains the tiles, and player supply areas.
There's a "Draw" stack (for selecting a new tile), and a "Stage" stack (to hold newly drawn tiles).  As you draw tiles, the game should update the number of remaining tiles.
Player supplies contain the player meeples, keeps, and an area to collect bonus tiles.
You can toggle the game window display by clicking on the game window button, <img src="images/ico_gamewindow.png" border="1">, or by pressing <b>CTRL-G</b>.
</td></tr></table>
<p><b><u>The Table</u></b><br>
<table border="0"><tr valign="top"><td>
<img src="images/help_table.png" border="1">
</td><td>
This is the area in which tiles are placed into play.  There is a visible grid on the table which shows you where tiles will be placed.
The castle walls enclose the playing area and provide starting locations.
The castle walls also provide the scoring track, and hold the bonus tiles.
The "zoom" of the table can be modified by clicking on the zoom buttons.  In addition the "Overview" button will toggle the display of the table overview.
You can not hide the table.

<h2>Setup</h2>
To set up a new game, choose the "New Game" item from the "File" menu.
At the start of a new game, the bonus tiles will be stacked on the table.  You can choose to manually distribute the bonus tiles, or you can use the auto setup feature.<p>
<img src="images/setupbonus.png" border="0"><br>
To activate auto setup, click the "auto setup" button.
Doing so will distribute the bonus tiles (remember to shuffle them first!), and remove the extra 5 bonus tiles from the game.<p>
If you wish to set the bonus tiles up manually, you should disable the auto setup feature (via the right-click menu).
<h2>Game Play</h2>
Once a game has been created and players have connected <i>(see the vassal help for how to play online)</i> the game can begin.<p>
A player generally begins their move by dragging a tile from "Draw" stack to the "Stage" stack.  Placing the tile in the "Stage" stack allows opponents to view the tile as the player contemplates how they will place the tile.  After contemplation, the player drags the tile from the "Stage" stack to the Table.  On the table, tiles will automatically snap to the visible grid.  Once on the table, tiles can be rotated via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-[</b> and <b>CTRL-]</b>.  Once a player is satisfied with the position and orientation of their tile, they "place" the tile via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-P</b>.  Once placed, the tile will have a thick red outline.  This outline always surrounds the most recently "placed" tile.  Once a tile is "placed" it can not be moved or rotated.  If a tile is "placed" in error, click on "Undo" twice, reposition it, and then "place" it again.<p>
Often after placing a tile, a player is allowed to place a piece onto that tile.  To do so, drag the piece from the game window to the table.  Player's meeples (followers) have two positions; standing <img src="images/meeple-light.png" border="0"> and lying down <img src="images/meeple-light-2.png" border="0">.  Change a meeples position via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-L</b>.<p>
When features are scored, pieces can be returned to their owner's supplies via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-A</b>.<p>
When a player has finished their move, the easiest way to signal that is pressing the "Done" button or by pressing <b>CTRL-D</b>.<p>
<h2>Largest House Indicator</h2>
A player's "keep" is placed on their largest completed house.  To help keep track you can modify a keeps indicator via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-[</b> and <b>CTRL-]</b>.
<h2>Scoring</h2>
Whenever scoring meeples share the same spot on the scoring track, they "stack together".  To select individual scoring meeples when stacked, first double-click on the stack of scoring meeples, then select your meeple to move it.  As you move your scoring meeples on the score track, the game will report scoring changes in the message window.  If you complete one trip around the score track you can increase your score by 100 points via the right-click menu or by pressing <b>CTRL-]</b>.
